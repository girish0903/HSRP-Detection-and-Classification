# High Security Registration Plate Detection and Classification

This project presents a novel approach for the detection and classification of High Security Registration Plates (HSRP) on vehicles. The proposed method utilizes object detection to locate HSRPs in images, followed by a classification step to determine if the detected object is an HSRP or not. The system aims to improve vehicle monitoring and public safety while maintaining data privacy.
